# Grocery List

Creating a list of groceries each week is painful. It's hard to organize, to check items off in the store, to write down ingredients from books, to combine the ingredients, and then must redo it all again the next week. Then there is the moment when you return home and realize you forgot something.

That's why I built this app. It simplifies the shopping experience and allows me to do more of what I love: cook. Check it out [here](https://groceries.brianbrown.dev).
